    <p>Cala Lily symbolizes purity and innocence, according to popular mythology. This flower is used at transitional times like weddings and funerals to symbolize a wish for fertility and purity for those who are making the transitions. In art, the Cala Lily has often been used as a connection between seemingly opposing forces. In Diego Rivera’s works, the Cala Lily calls our attention to the connection between the wealthy and working classes. Georgia O’Keefe’s paintings of Cala Lily focus on the connection between the masculine and feminine, highlighting the beauty of the two balanced within the form of this flower.</p>
